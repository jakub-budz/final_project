In order to empower and heal our citizens, we must ensure that all residents can pursue opportunities to thrive without fear of violence by providing prevention and intervention supports that are available to individuals of all ages and levels of risk. Indicators associated with this pillar include violent crime incidents; violent crime victimization;5 domestic violence incidents; serious victimization (fatal and non-fatal shootings); recidivism (as measure by re-arrest); youth engaged in various supportive programs;
individuals engaged by street outreach and victim services; individuals diverted from the criminal justice system; and re-entering residents. As a point of departure, crime incidence was measured using data for what are commonly known as index crimes, representing the most serious violent and property offenses. Violent index crimes include aggravated assaults, aggravated batteries, criminal sexual assaults, homicides, and robberies. Property index crimes include arsons, burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and thefts. Due to the unprecedented events of 2020 (i.e., global pandemic and civil unrest), we separated the pandemic years (2020 and 2021) from the previous years. Hence, in this section 2020 and 2021 numbers are compared to the 2018-2019 average separately. Compared to the 2018-2019 average, Chicago experienced increases of incidence for aggravated assault and homicide in 2021. However, compared to the 2018-2019 average decreases were observed for aggravated battery, criminal sexual assault, and robbery in 2021 (Figure 5). For property crimes, compared to the 2018-2019 average, there were increases in incidence of arsons and motor vehicle thefts, and decreases for burglaries and thefts in 2021 (Figure 6). Rates of reported incidents of domestic violence (which are included among the violent index crimes, but also include simple assaults and batteries) slightly increased in 2021 (10.74 per 1,000 compared to previous 3-year average of 10.49 per 1,000). It is important to note that this is the rate for the reported domestic violence incidents, not all domestic violence incidents as many of these incidents go unreported. Furthermore, there was a significant shift in how survivors of domestic violence sought help. Compared to the 2018-2019 average, there was a slight increase (0.6%) in calls for help to Illinois Domestic Violence Hotline in Chicago. This change was more pronounced in 2021, where the calls for help to the Illinois Domestic Violence Hotline in Chicago increased by 6.2% compared to 2018-2019 average (Figure 7).7 The rise in domestic violence calls to hotlines was consistent with a national - even global - pattern of a rise in domestic and intimate partner violence due to social isolation and restrictions posed by the pandemic. Regarding violent crime victimizations during the 2018-21 period, there were increasing trends for aggravated assault, non-fatal shootings, vehicular hijacking, and fatal shootings, and decreasing trend for robberies, non-shooting homicides and aggravated batteries (Figure 8). In 2021, 30% of all aggravated assault and 50% of all aggravated battery victims were domestic violence victims. Overall, domestic violence victimization accounted for 22% of all violent crime victimization in 2020 and 2021. Another indicator to measure our progress in empowering and healing all Chicagoans affected by violence is assessing the rate of re-arrest to approximate trends of recidivism. In 2021 in Chicago, the rate of re-arrest for violent index crimes within 12, 24, and 36 months of a previous arrest was 30.0%, 44.2%, and 52.4%, respectively (i.e., in 2021, 30.0% of individuals arrested for a violent index crime had been arrested for a crime within the 12 months prior). Generally, these re-arrest rates were stable during 2018-21, with a slight reduction observed in 2021 compared to 2020 (Figure 9). While the statistics demonstrated thus far mostly show an increasing trend in violent crimesconsistent with other major cities, the City has dedicated millions of dollars and administers several programs for prevention and intervention supports for both youth and adults at the highest risk of involvement in violence. The City has implemented several programs which offer support services tailored towards youth. These programs can help mitigate exposure to neighborhood violence and help youth avoid involvement in the criminal justice system. In spite of the pandemic, several youth programs in Chicago continued to operate with success in their primary prevention efforts: The Choose to Change program (C2C) is a six-month intervention that offers youth intensive wraparound and professional mentoring services that focus on addressing each young person’s specific needs, with trauma-informed cognitive behavioral therapy that helps youth process their trauma and develop a new set of decision-making tools. In 2021, the number of youth enrolled in the program increased by 47%, from 444 youth enrolled in 2020 to 654 youth in 2021. According to mid-study report data released by the University of Chicago Education and Crime Labs that examined 2015-2019 data, C2C has positive impacts on youth both in the short- and longer-term. Youth enrolled in the program were found to have 48% fewer violent-crime arrests than their control peers while enrolled in the program, 38% fewer violent-crime arrests a year and a half after program completion, and 33% fewer violent-crime arrests two and a half years after the program ends.10 The Service Coordination and Navigation (SCaN) program model seeks to stabilize eligible youth in their environment, increase their self-efficacy, and assist in their transition to adulthood by offering employment and education supports. In 2021, SCaN had an active enrollment of 652 majority young adult Black males enrolled in the program. The City is currently collecting data and evaluating the long-term outcomes of the SCaN program which will be provided in future reports. The Office of the Mayor, Chicago Police Department, and Department of Family and Support Services are currently developing
a new youth diversion model to replace current processes that is aimed at being respectful, equitable, trauma-informed, and datadriven, resulting in positive outcomes for youth, families, and communities. This work is being supported with $10M in funding
from the Chicago Recovery Plan (CRP). Programs for adults in Chicago have centered on implementing a trauma-informed approach for helping those who are at the greatest risk for violence exposure. Additionally, policy measures have been taken to offer diversionary options for individuals experiencing substance use disorders, and for returning citizens: As part of Metropolitan Family Services’11 network (MFS), Communities Partnering 4 Peace (CP4P) street outreach organizations12 have been actively working to quell unrest in several of Chicago’s community areas on the south and west sides. In 2020, Chicago Department of Public Health funded street outreach organizations under MFS in 17 community areas for a total of $6,500,00013, and several non-MFS victim services organizations serving 11 communities14 for a total of $1,500,000. These investments were nexpanded in 2021, with MFS-led street outreach receiving $12,475,000, victim services receiving $2,475,000, and new independent street outreach programs being onboarded at $2,000,000 to serve 6 additional communities15. The impact of increased funding can be seen in the significant increases in the number of individuals referred to and enrolled in mental/behavioral health services, as well as those who received victim services. There was a decrease in the number of individuals connected to services by street outreach due to changes in the partnership with a subcontractor. Furthermore, this particular indicator (individuals connected to services) accounts for the number of newly enrolled street outreach participants. This means that in 2020 there were 680 and in 2021 there were 248 newly connected street outreach participants, but, over the course of the 2020-2021 period, approximately 900 individuals were connected to services (Figure 10). The Northwestern Neighborhood and Network Initiative (N3) at the Northwestern University’s Institute for Policy and Research is currently performing an evaluation of the impact of street outreach on violence in Chicago. Their preliminary results shows that CP4P successfully locates high-risk populations and potentially increases educational and employment opportunities while reducing the risk of gun violence involvement for the participants.18 Additional preventive and diversionary measures have been implemented by the City such that the burden placed on the individual and criminal legal system may be minimized. In 2016, the Chicago Police Department and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (federal law enforcement focused on drug trafficking) partnered with the community healthcare provider Thresholds, and the University of Chicago Crime Lab and Health Lab to design, test, and scale the Chicago Police Department Narcotics Arrest Diversion Program (NADP), a police-led drug deflection program that offers substance use treatment in place of formal criminal justice system processing. NADP is a citywide program first piloted in the community areas in the City’s west side. The program seeks to address the root cause of opioid and other substance use by providing a supportive - rather than punitive - intervention for individuals with substance use disorders. City-wide data on NADP is available starting August 2020. From August to December 2020, 78 individuals were served by NADP, compared to 309 in 2021. Looking into the 2018-2020 data where the program was active only in districts 10, 11, 15, and 25, Crime Lab found that the program reduces the time officers spend on processing low-level drug offenses, decreases the likelihood of re-involvement with the criminal justice system, connects individuals with substance use disorders to treatment, and improves public safety. The City Colleges of Chicago have implemented programs funded through legal cannabis sales-tax revenue, including Still I Rise (SIR) and Roots of Success (ROS). The goal of SIR is to prevent violence by providing wraparound services and free education and certification to individuals with violence involvement who have cannabis records, allowing them to obtain a living wage job in the legal cannabis market. ROS is an environmental literacy program that will be a pipeline into the SIR program. The Spring 2021 SIR pilot cohort concluded in August 2021, with 10 of the 11 students completing the program. ROS training was offered at OliveHarvey College and community partner locations in Fall 2021. Six of the 11 participants completed the program and received their certificates of ROS completion. In 2021, the City Colleges of Chicago, Richard J. Daley College partnered with the Inner-City Muslim Action Network (IMAN) to implement the Weekend Warriors program. The program aims to positively engage returning residents and at-risk individuals on the weekends by offering students quality college-level instruction, career services, behavioral health therapy, individual case management, artistic programming, select weekend excursions, transportation support, meals, and weekly stipends. Beginning in early 2021, the Office of the Mayor and various partner organizations convened a Working Group on Returning Residents to discuss the challenges faced by Chicagoans returning from jail or prison, and to propose recommendations for how the City could address those challenges. The goal of this Working Group was to understand the ways in which the City has tried to support returning residents in the past, recognize where it has been successful, acknowledge where it has fallen short, and look to best practices around the country for a path forward to meaningfully improve the life outcomes of returning residents. These efforts culminated in the successful creation of a Chicago Interagency Reentry Council, a full-time Director of Reentry position in the Office of the Mayor, and increased investments for services which serve returning residents in the City of Chicago 2022 Budget. Additionally, the City has invested millions of dollars in services that promote safety and well-being of all Chicagoans. $10M from the CRP has been dedicated to support victim services, increasing support to organizations who provide direct, long-term services to victims of crime and their loves ones. Supporting families in the immediate aftermath of a violence crime is critical. Victim services teams across Chicago provide supports such as assistance with funeral planning, applying for crime victim compensation, grief counseling, and other mental health supports, addressing safety concerns, and providing support for an array of practical and essential needs. The Mayor’s 2022 budget includes $25M in new investments that support survivors of gender-based violence and human trafficking, including $5M in funding for young people who have witnesses or experienced violence at home. The investments would provide emergency financial assistance, legal services, housing, services for young people, and prevention education efforts. The City is placing emphasis on making communities most affected by violence safer by reclaiming public places as safe spaces within communities by promoting community well-being with stable housing, amenities, commerce, and opportunities. Indicators associated with this pillar include community perception of resource accessibility and safety; 311 requests for public safetyrelated services; 911 calls related to violence; the safety gap; vacant lot restoration; and infrastructure improvements. Understanding community perceptions of safety and resource accessibility will be a crucial first step in advancing the ability to protect and secure places in Chicago. Assessment of these perceptions was measured using data provided by the Chicago Department of Public Health from the community-based survey, Healthy Chicago Survey, 2020 (Figures 11-13).20 Items from the survey were demarcated into several neighborhood constructs, including:
Safety:
- “Do you feel safe in your neighborhood?”
- “In your neighborhood, how often does violence occur?”
Institutional Trust:
- “To what extent do you trust local government to do what’s right for your community?”
- “To what extend do you trust your local government to do what’s right for your community”
Resource Accessibility:
-“It is easy to walk, scoot or roll to a transit stop (bus, train) from my home” 
Examining responses from these survey items from a city-wide level, while instructive, may tell an incomplete story of public perceptions of safety, institutional trust, and resource accessibility among specific populations and communities. For instance, when compared to other racial/ethnic groups, non-Latinx Black/African Americans report the lowest trust of law enforcement, and lowest perceived neighborhood safety, but similar rates of exposure to violence as non-Latinx Whites. Gathering more data for the next few years will be essential in achieving a more complete picture and understanding of community perception of resource accessibility and safety. The Office of the Mayor will continue to work with Healthy Chicago Survey to achieve this goal. In order to address the institutional trust in government and ensure safety of Chicagoans in their neighborhoods, the City of Chicago implemented a new approach in summer 2021. The Summer Safety Strategy (SSS) was a holistic strategy to address community safety at a hyperlocal level. The SSS approach involved a) identifying the most violent police beats across the city, b) convening local leaders and service providers along with key city departments, and c) targeting the remediation of “hot” issues on a weekly basis. Coordination included  maintaining City department presence through City service blitzes, tailored police deployments that included proactive engagement such as foot patrols and community safety walks, and collaboration with community-based organizations to provide services to community members. For instance, the Chicago Department of Transportation made sure to provide adequate lighting in hotspots, Department of Streets and Sanitation cleaned and cleared vacant lots, and the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection provided additional security support for businesses. Institutional trust and perception of safety may also be elevated by addressing the disproportionate amount of violence in communities of color. For this reason, the concept and estimation of the “safety gap” is a key outcome for the OCOS plan. The safety gap provides an indication of disparity between communities historically known to experience high levels of violence and communities that historically have experienced relatively low levels of violence. The safety gap was calculated by comparing the serious victimization (fatal and non-fatal shootings) rates for the 15 priority community areas with the highest serious victimization rates to the remaining 62 community areas. These geographically based rates per 10,000 residents21 were then compared annually between 2018 and 2021. (Figure 14). Using this methodology, the safety gap has generally increased over time (particularly between 2018-19 and 2020-21), indicating an increasing disparity (i.e., difference) in serious victimizations between the 15 priority community areas compared to the remaining 62 community areas. In other words, these 15 community areas have had higher rates of fatal and non-fatal shootings per 10,000 residents, than all other 62 communities combined. The safety gap is a key indicator for long-term progress of our violence reduction strategy in Chicago. During 2020-21, many of the neighborhoods most affected by violence were also managing the challenges associated with COVID-19, which could partially explain the widening of the safety gap. A continued commitment to vigilant monitoring of geographic disparities in violence is a primary point of emphasis for the City. Calls for service are an additional indicator that can potentially help shed light on trends of violence and public safety in Chicago. However, these measures do have limitations, as research indicates that African Americans are less likely to call 911 for matters
of personal and public safety. There was a very slight decreasing trend of total 911 calls and 911 calls for violent crimes during 2018-21. Aggravated batteries
were the most common violent crime-related 911 calls, accounting for an average of 57.8% of all violent crime-related 911 calls during this time span (Figure 15). While aggravated batteries accounted for more than half of all violent-crime related calls, it is important to note that most 911 calls were regarding non-violent crimes (e.g., disturbances, property crimes). In fact, during the four-year period, violent crime related calls accounted for only an average of 1.61% of all 911 calls annually (Figure 16). There was an overall increasing trend of total 311 calls during 2018-21. However, when examining specifically public safety-related 311 calls (e.g., those related to graffiti, non-functioning streetlights, abandoned buildings, etc.), a slight decreasing trend was observed. Graffiti removal was the most common concern, accounting for an average of 63% of public-safety related calls to 311 (Figure 17). Further, most 311 calls are not public safety related. Overall, during the four-year period, public safety-related 311 calls accounted for an average of 6.8% of all 311 calls annually, and tended to decrease over time (Figure 18).  In order to address these public safety concerns in the short-term and reduce the safety gap in the long-term, the City has invested in several place-based initiatives and programs. Some of the City’s primary initiatives to protect and secure places have been the Invest South/West Initiative, the Neighborhood Activation Initiative, and the intentional restoration of vacant spaces. Invest South/West: This Mayoral initiative that was launched in 2019 in collaboration with the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) has now totaled more than $1.4 billion in public and private investments to support small businesses, create public realm improvements, restore buildings, and foster equity. Neighborhood Activation: This is a focused violence prevention and community investment initiative that combines community aspirations with City investments and assets to implement programs, social services, and changes to the built environment at a hyper-local block level. The first pilot of Neighborhood Activation is focused on a few key blocks in West Garfield Park. The Office of the Mayor partnered with the Garfield Park Rite to Wellness Collaborative, Studio Gang, the Goldin Institute, and community residents to understand community needs and envision solutions. Resulting projects included tree planting, youth summer jobs and programming, beautification of vacant lots, monthly produce markets at Legler Library in partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository, improvements to the public way to promote pedestrian safety, mural and art projects, community-designed street banners, and more, with additional investments to come. One key project was the development of a Community Plaza and Roller Rink at 4008 W. Madison Street. The Community Plaza is a safe outdoor space in the neighborhood for residents to gather and build community. Vacant Lot Restoration: There has been strong evidence to suggest that unmaintained, vegetative spaces which are subject to blight may foster crime. Conversely, areas of maintained and healthy vegetation are believed to be protective against crime.24 Research has suggested that as physical signs of disorder become more apparent in a neighborhood, residents are not as likely to interact, causing reduced community attachment, collective efficacy, and mobility.25 Through an $87M investment in vacant lot restoration in 2022, the City aims to reactivate vacant city-owned land and build community wealth by streamlining environmental reviews and transferring ownership to neighborhood residents for community benefit. Additionally, the City has dedicated ARP Funding to directly enhance place-based strategies such as housing investments, revitalization of commercial corridors, and improvement of local parks, all of which create community infrastructure which can promote reduction of violence. A detailed breakdown of these efforts is listed below:
- $241.4M in housing investments to create and preserve safe and affordable housing:
- $12M for an acquisition rehab program to identify and restore troubled and abandoned homes and buildings
 in priority neighborhoods.
- $75.1M to create mixed-use, multi-family developments
- $30M to support owner-occupied repairs and smaller scale rehabs
- $60.3M to address home hazards such as lead-based paint
- $11M to provide direct homebuyer assistance and expand opportunities for home ownership through land preparation
- $186M to support small businesses, revitalize commercial corridors, and create local opportunities:
- $77M to revitalize commercial corridors, support small business owners, activate vacant storefronts,
 and bring neighborhood amenities to communities
- $54M to rehabilitate vacant commercial and mixed-use buildings in commercial corridors
- $15M to promote community wealth building via business ownerships
- $10M to expand food equity through entrepreneurship
- $20M to support business development and tourism
- $10M to support equitable transit-oriented development
- $16M to support arts and culture
- $35.6M to improve local parks.
With a national spotlight placed on the relationship between individuals and law enforcement in the last year, the City has redoubled its commitment to increasing police legitimacy in communities where trust has eroded by ensuring humane, effective, and constitutional law enforcement practices. Indicators for this pillar include the following: community perception of trust in law enforcement; clearance rate for homicides and non-fatal shootings; use of force; guns recovered; police department staff who completed Crisis Intervention Training; consent decree compliance; and staff recruited and promoted to meet diversity, equity, and inclusion standards. In partnership with ZenCity (previously Elucd), the Chicago Police Department gathers 1,500-2,000 survey responses from Chicago residents every month, across all 22 police districts in the City to better understand perceptions of safety and levels of trust in law enforcement. On a scale of 1-10, individuals are asked to respond to questions regarding Perception of safety in Chicago: “When it comes to the threat of crime, how safe do you feel in your neighborhood?” Trust in law enforcement (average taken for the following two items): “How much do you agree with this statement? The police in my neighborhood listen to and take into account the concerns of local residents” “How much do you agree with this statement? The police in my neighborhood treat local residents with respect”26 Examination of these data revealed a steady decline in perception of safety which could be attributed to the rise in violent crimes. However, perceptions of trust in law enforcement have fluctuated over the years. Although there was a decrease in the average trust score in 2021 as compared to 2020, the longer-term trend shows a slight increase in overall trust scores during the 2018-21 period (Figure 19). The ability of police to clear cases in a timely manner can have impacts on residents’ trust in law enforcement, actual levels of safety, and the reduction of violence.27 “Clearance by arrest” is defined as at least one person associated with a crime being arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution. “Clearance by exception” refers to the scenario when elements beyond law enforcement’s control prevent the agency from arresting and charging an offender. In order to clear an offense exceptionally, the agency must meet all of the 4 following criteria: the agency must have a) identified the offender; b) gathered enough evidence to support an arrest, make a charge, and turn over the offender to the court for prosecution; c) identified the offender’s exact location; d) encountered a circumstance outside the control of law enforcement that prohibits arrest (e.g., death of offender).28 Over the previous four-year period, annual clearance rates (which includes both clearance by arrest and exception) for homicides were between 41.6% and 49.2%, with the highest rate being observed in 2019. Annual clearance rates for non-fatal shootings were between 7.9% and 11.9%, with the lowest rate being observed in 2020 (Figure 20). As can be seen in Figure 21, there is stability over time for clearance by exception for non-fatal shootings. Comparatively, clearance by exception rates for homicides were more unstable; while there was a significant decrease in clearance by exception in 2020 as compared to 2019, the rate increased again in 2021. The trends for clearance by arrest remained mostly stable for homicides and shootings between 2018 and 2021 (Figure 22).  Improving law enforcement performance and enhancing community safety may also be achieved through the removal of guns from the streets. Taking guns out of communities may fall into two distinct categories: gun recovery (criminal circumstances) and guns that are turned in or found (non-criminal circumstances). Inclusively, there has been a general increase in guns recovered/ turned in or found between 2018 and 2021 (Figure 23). For both categories combined, more than 50% of guns were from the 15 priority community areas annually (Figure 24). In addition to improving clearance rates and taking guns off the streets, trust in law enforcement can be strengthened by enhancing the quality of citizen-police interactions. The stability of these interactions can be approximated by examining police use of force via Tactical Response Report (TRR) documentation. TRRs are used to document, investigate, and evaluate reported use of force incidents where members respond to the actions of a subject, including any force mitigation efforts, or when members use a reportable use of force. Between 2018 and 2021, we see consistency of the percentage of TRRs by subject race, as seen in Figure 25 (predominantly Black; approximately 75% of annual TRRs). Overall, the frequency of TRRs decreased in 2021 (3,318 reports) compared to the annual average between 2018 and 2020 (4,645 reports).  In order to reduce the racial disparity of subject injury by police, CPD conducted extensive community engagement on various CPD policies, including Use of Force, School Resource Officers, and interactions with members of specific populations, such as transgender, intersex, and gender non-confirming individuals. CPD also improved transparency by revamping their public use of force dashboard. Police officers often respond to situations involving individuals experiencing a behavioral or mental health crisis. To remedy increasing rates of use of force interactions between citizens in crisis and police officers, the Chicago Police Department has invested in training and staffing the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT). An explicit goal of trainings is to ensure that police interactions with individuals in crisis will be carried out with dignity and respect.29 Officers who have completed this 40-hour training are more knowledgeable about the signs and symptoms of mental illness, and are trained on how to interact, intervene, and de-escalate situations with persons in crisis and potentially in need of a psychiatric evaluation.30 During the time period 2018-2021, 1,720 law enforcement officers completed CIT training. Compared to previous years, a drop in enrollment was experienced in 2020, which may be partly attributed to a temporary suspension of training due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The demographic profile of CITtrained officers during 2018-21 was consistent with the current demographic profile of the police force as a whole: 71.6% male (74.8% for all CPD), 22.9% Black (22.2% for all CPD), 26.2% Hispanic (28.3% for all CPD; includes individuals identifying as Hispanic, White Hispanic, and Black Hispanic), and 46.6% White (45.4% for all CPD) (Figure 26). One of the important initiatives to increase the sense of safety and trust in law enforcement is the Chicago Neighborhood Policing Initiative (CNPI). In January 2019, the Chicago Police Department in collaboration with the Policing Project at New York University School of Law launched CNPI, a pilot in the 25th District designed to increase positive contact between police officers and neighborhood community members.31 Interim findings published in May 2021 by Northwestern University’s N3 show that both CPD and residents noted positive changes in the first year of the program in the relationship between police and community. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd affected the City, CPD was forced to shift its focus to the immediate needs of the City’s communities. The pandemic also caused obstacles by limiting face-to-face interactions and close collaborations with community-based organizations, both of which were crucial to the CNPI foundation, and thus limited the potential beneficial effects of the program. Currently, the CNPI has expanded its reach to 10 police districts to continue fostering problem solving and relationship building between community and police. In addition, the Chicago Police Department is under Consent Decree through the Department of Justice and the Illinois Attorney General’s Office. This Consent Decree guides reform efforts and consists of 799 paragraphs. On a regular basis, the Independent Monitoring Team (IMT) assesses the department’s progress toward the aims expressed in each paragraph. Reform of the department is considered to be a primary driver of violence reduction efforts, in that as the public increases its trust in the police department, their partnership and cooperation with the police enables higher levels of service and protection. The City of Chicago achieved some level of compliance with over half of the 507 paragraphs assessed in the IMT’s fourth report. Chicago has achieved some level of compliance with more paragraphs than any other comparable city in its first two years under consent decree (total of 266 paragraphs). CPD achieved several accomplishments with respect to the Consent Decree in 2021 in the below topic areas. Community Policing: Expanded the Neighborhood Policing Initiative, which emphasizes problem solving and relationship building, to 10 police districts. Implemented an annual community-driven, district-level strategic planning process in all 22 districts. Impartial Policing: Hired CPD’s first-ever language access and Americans with Disabilities Act coordinators. Revised Department’s policy on interactions with Transgender, Intersex, and Gender Non-Conforming individuals based on extensive community dialogue. Delivered a 24-hour, three-part training on Procedural Justice to in-service members. Crisis Intervention: Revised CPD’s suite of policies on response to individuals in crisis with extensive community input from the Chicago Council on Mental Health Equity. Revised Department’s 40-hour Basic CIT training for certified CIT officers with extensive input from a community working group. Use of Force: Revised CPD’s suite of use of force policies multiple times, based on extensive dialogue with the community. Implemented mandatory annual in-service training for all officers on de-escalation, response to resistance, and use of force. Created the Force Review Division to conduct systematic reviews of use of force incidents. Recruitment, Hiring, and Promotions:Completed an extensive, independent evaluation of the Department’s promotional processes for the ranks of Sergeant and Lieutenant. Created a brand-new unit dedicated exclusively to recruitment efforts in an effort to grow and diversify pool of police officer candidates. Training: Increased the number of mandatory annual training hours for in-service officers from 0 prior to the consent decree to now 40 hours in 2021. Supervision:Developed expansion plans of the Unity of Command/Span of Control pilot program, which will help supervisors be better equipped to lead, monitor & assist officers under their supervision. Piloted a new staffing model that limits the number of officers per supervisor and ensures consistency of supervision day-to-day. Started a pilot program for CPD’s new Officer Support System to identify and support officers who may be at risk for adverse outcomes. This program will serve as a national model for identifying the assisting officers in need. Officer Wellness: Expanded the clinical capacity from 3 full-time clinicians to 10 full-time clinicians. Accountability & Transparency: Began publicly publishing summary reports that detail misconduct investigations and findings, improving transparency on accountability procedures Data Collection, Analysis, and Management: Published new public dashboards on use of force, accountability, community sentiment, and other metrics to improve transparency. Piloted a new Officer Support System designed to help supervisors identify members who may be at-risk for adverse outcomes and determine possible interventions and supports for those members. The City emphasizes developing policies that are fair, effective, inclusive, and reflective of the community needs. In 2021, the City Plan and Coordinate implemented several policies related to public safety and violence reduction: Research has long shown an association between increases in violent crime incidents and outlets that sell alcohol for off-premise consumption such as liquor stores. In June 2021, as part of the “Chi Biz Strong” package, the City Council passed a legislation prohibiting the sale of packaged alcohol after 12:00 am to reduce neighborhood disturbances and ensure the safety of residents. In July 2021, the City Council passed legislation to create the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability which will enable the public to have a direct hand in police department policymaking. In January 2022, Mayor Lightfoot selected Executive Director Adam Gross to lead the Commission’s important work. In September 2021, the Mayor published the City’s first ever citywide strategic plan to address gender-based violence (GBV) and human trafficking. The work to build this plan began in February 2021 when Mayor Lightfoot launched the GBV Advisory Council. Since then, the City has led a robust and inclusive community engagement process, bringing together community partners, survivors, and City officials to define key problems and solutions-driven strategies. As part of the overall violence reduction strategy, this plan seeks to build the muscle within City government to understand and address GBV and human trafficking; design a citywide ecosystem that adequately prevents, responds, and intervenes in cases of GBV and human trafficking in traumainformed and culturally specific ways; and invest in critical services to stabilize survivors and increase safety. The City piloted the Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement Program (CARE) in Fall 2021 to help resolve immediate mental health related emergencies. The CARE Program integrates behavioral healthcare professionals into the 911 response system to ensure that individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis are met with a team of professionals who can help to resolve the immediate crisis and connect the person in crisis to appropriate community-based resources and supports. Furthermore, as part of Mayor’s commitment to transparency and data-driven policy making, the City is partnering with University of Chicago, Health Lab to conduct a process evaluation of the CARE program. In November 2021, Mayor Lightfoot signed an executive order, creating the Chicago Interagency Reentry Council, tasked with promoting positive reentry for Chicagoans returning from incarceration in prison and jail. While there are various City-led initiatives alongside community-based efforts to address violence in Chicago, most of these Plan and Coordinate efforts have operated in silos. In August, 2021, Mayor Lightfoot activated the Community Safety Coordination Center (CSCC) to provide the coordination and resources needed to implement the strategies within OCOS. Led by a Chief Coordination Officer, the CSCC brings together representatives from City departments with community organizations to: engage residents and organizations in ways that are inclusive of the whole community and include representatives from healthcare and mental health, violence reduction, youth services, victim services, education, faith organizations, local businesses, elected officials, and City services; provide transparent data sources and analysis on violent crime and the root causes of violence, including data on where violence occurs, how the built environment influences violence, and where communities require additional capacity to support those at risk of violence; and coordinate City services to rapidly respond to the needs identified by community members to prevent or reduce violence. The CSCC will coordinate activities that impact every community in Chicago, but is focused on implementing operations in the 15 priority communities identified in OCOS. To ensure the CSCC’s approach is guided by an overarching strategy informed by community, a Launch Committee was formed to develop guiding principles for the CSCC work and implement community-driven initiatives. The Launch Committee includes representatives from OCOS focus communities, violence prevention experts, and research leaders from throughout the City. A critical part of the CSCC is to coordinate the City’s own resources through the lens of violence reduction, including the funding being allocated towards programming and operations. A strategic advisory group was formed that includes senior leadership from the Office of the Mayor and several key departments. Together, the advisory group is working to implement a community safety framework to ensure alignment with policies and strategies identified in OCOS. Under the CSCC framework, near-term public safety activities are described in Figure 27.
