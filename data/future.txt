The year 2021 brought about significant challenges to all Chicagoans, from the continued fight against the COVID-19 pandemic to the national surge in homicides and violent crime. There is so much work to be done. We will continue to address violence as a public health crisis that is preventable and treatable by sustained effort over several years to address the root causes of violence. In 2022, we will continue to improve trust in law enforcement, particularly among minority groups. We will also dedicate our resources to closing the safety gap and addressing socioeconomic disparity in those community areas most affected by violence. We will further invest in youth programs, diversionary policy measures, environmental modification, and will partner with subject matter experts to evaluate these programs. Finally, we will carry on with our commitment to data-driven solutions and national best practices to address violence.
